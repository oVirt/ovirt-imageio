ovirt-imageio enables uploading and downloading of disks and snapshots using HTTPS.

The project provides ovirt-imageio service and imageio client library.

ovirt-imageio service can act in two different roles:

- as a service exposing images over HTTPS, allowing clients to read and write images.

- as a proxy service, allowing clients without access to the host network to read and write images.

imageio client library provides wrapper around REST API provided by ovirt-imageio.
Besides making REST API easy to use, it also provides other features like on-the-fly image
format conversion or support for incremental backup out of the box. It can also be used
as a reference implementation of imageio client.

## How this project is related to other oVirt projects?

- vdsm - control and monitor imageio service, prepare and finalize
  upload and download operations.

- engine - manage upload and download operations, communicating with
  vdsm and imageio service running on the engine. Engine does not communicate with imageio
  service on the hosts.
